# EDA-on-supermarket-sales
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file named eda_sup.ipynb that performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on supermarket sales data.

## Project Description
The eda_sup.ipynb notebook is an exploratory data analysis project that aims to analyze and gain insights from a dataset of supermarket sales. The notebook uses Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform the analysis.

The EDA process involves loading and exploring the dataset, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and conducting various data visualizations to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. The notebook includes code examples and detailed explanations for each step of the analysis.

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

- Explore the structure and characteristics of the supermarket sales dataset.
- Identify any missing or inconsistent data and handle them appropriately.
- Perform statistical analysis and visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.
- Analyze the relationship between different variables in the dataset.
